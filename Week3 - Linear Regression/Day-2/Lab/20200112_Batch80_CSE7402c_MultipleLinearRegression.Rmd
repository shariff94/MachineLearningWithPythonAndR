**NOTE** Before starting this assignment please remember to clear your environment, you can do that by running the following code chunk
### Clear the environment
```{r}

rm(list = ls(all=TRUE))
```

### Load the required libraries
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(caret)
library(modes)
library(gtools)

```

### Reading & Understanding the Data

* Make sure the dataset is located in your current working directory

```{r}

housing_data <- read.csv("housing_data.csv",header=T,sep=",")

```

* Use the str() function to get a feel for the dataset.

```{r}

str(housing_data)

```
#### Observation:
* The dataset has 500 rows and 13 attributes and one tagret MV.
* CHAS and RAD should be categorical just they are showing the numerical values

### Converting into required Data Types
```{r}
housing_data$CHAS = as.factor(housing_data$CHAS)
housing_data$RAD = as.factor(housing_data$RAD)
```

### View few rows of data from top and bottom
* Take a look at the data using the "head()" and "tail()" functions

```{r}

head(housing_data)

tail(housing_data)

```


### Ask and Explore interesting Questions

1) __How does the proportion of African-Americans by town relate to the Median Value of owner-occupied homes?__

2) __How does the nitric oxides concentration measured as ppm in the air relate to the Median Value of owner-occupied homes?__

3) ????

4) ????

* So, let's get ready to predict the prices of houses!!

# Exploratory Analysis

## Summary Statistics

* Understand the distribution of various variables in the datset using the "summary()" function

```{r}

summary(housing_data)

```
#### Observation
* There are NA values in all the attributes except the target column.



### Data Pre-processing

* Today we will impute missing values and standardize the data __after__ splitting the data into train and test sets

## Train/Test Split

* 70/30 - Train/Test split

```{r}

set.seed(29)

# the "sample()" function helps us to randomly sample 70% of the row indices of the dataset

train_rows <- sample(x = 1:nrow(housing_data), size = 0.7*nrow(housing_data))

# We use the above indices to subset the train and test sets from the data

train_data <- housing_data[train_rows, ]

test_data <- housing_data[-train_rows, ]

```

## Missing Values imputation

* Find out the number of missing values in the dataset

* Impute the missing values using the "preProcess()" function in conjunction with the "knnImpute" method

```{r}
#install.packages("caret")
sum(is.na(train_data))

library(caret)

imputer_values <- preProcess(x = train_data, method = "medianImpute")

sum(is.na(train_data))

train_data <- predict(object = imputer_values, newdata = train_data)

sum(is.na(train_data))

sum(is.na(test_data))

test_data <- predict(object = imputer_values, newdata = test_data)

sum(is.na(test_data))
```

### Imputing the categorical values with the mode

```{r}

library(DMwR)
train_data = centralImputation(train_data)
test_data = centralImputation(test_data)
```


### Scatter Plots

* A few bi-variate relationships are plotted below, but you are encouraged to explore the dataset in more detail

```{r fig.height= 8, fig.width = 9}

par(mfrow = c(2,2))

plot(housing_data$LSTAT, housing_data$MV, ylab = "Median House Price", xlab = "Percentage of people in the lower economic strata", main = "Housing Price vs Status")

plot(housing_data$CRIM, housing_data$MV, ylab = "Median House Price", xlab = "Per capita crime by town", main = "Housing Price vs Per Capita Crime")

plot(housing_data$NOX, housing_data$MV, ylab = "Median House Price", xlab = "Nitric Oxide Concentration in ppm", main = "Housing Price vs NOX concentration in ppm")

plot(housing_data$INDUS, housing_data$MV, ylab = "Median House Price", xlab = "Proportion of non-retail business acres per town", main = "Housing Price vs Non-retail business area")
```
### Split the numerical and categorical attributes
```{r}
cols = colnames(train_data[,!names(train_data)%in%c("MV")])
numAttr = c()
catAttr = c()
for (i in cols){
  if (is.numeric(train_data[,c(i)])!=T){
    catAttr = c(catAttr,i)
  }else 
  numAttr = c(numAttr,i)
}
cat("\n The Categorical Attributes =",catAttr)
cat("\n The Numerical Attributes =  ",numAttr)

```


### Correlation Plot for Numerical Attributes

* Let's have a look at the various correlations between the numerical variables in the dataset

```{r fig.height= 8, fig.width = 9}
#install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)

corrplot(cor(housing_data[,numAttr], use = "complete.obs"), method = "number")

```
#### Observation:
* There are correlations which have high magnitude but with both directions 
* Example NOX and INDUS are positively correlated,DIS and Age
* LSTAT and MV are having strong ngeative correlation
* "Correlation is not a causation" we have to check for the mutual effects of the numerical attributes and hence we are not removing any attribute here.

### Chisquare test on Categorical Attributes
```{r}
contingency = table(train_data$CHAS,train_data$RAD)
chisq.test(contingency)
```
#### Observation:
* Null Hypothesis in Chisquare test for independence is the two attributes are independent.
* Since pValue is 0.44 which is greater than 0.05 we have to accept the null hypothesis that they are independent.



### Standardizing the Data

* We will use the Caret pakcage to standardize the data after the split using the __"preProcess()"__ function

* It saves the metrics such as mean and standard deviation used for calculating the standardized value by creating a model object

* We can then use the model object in the __"predict()"__ function to standardize any other unseen dataset with the same distribuiton and variables

```{r}

library(caret)

# The "preProcess()" function creates a model object required for standardizing unseen data

# Do not standardize the target variable

std_model <- preProcess(train_data[, numAttr], method = c("center", "scale"))

# The predict() function is used to standardize any other unseen data

train_data[, numAttr] <- predict(object = std_model, newdata = train_data[, numAttr])

test_data[, numAttr] <- predict(object = std_model, newdata = test_data[,numAttr])

```


# Modelling the Data

## Basic Model

* The "." adds all the variables other than the response variable while building the model.

```{r}

model_basic <- lm(formula = MV~. , data = train_data)

summary(model_basic)

par(mfrow = c(2,2))

plot(model_basic)

```

## stepAIC model

* "stepAIC()" is a function in the MASS package

* stepAIC uses AIC (Akaike information criterion) to either drop variables ("backward" direction) or add variables ("forward" direction) from the model

```{r}

library(MASS)

model_aic <- stepAIC(model_basic, direction = "both")

summary(model_aic)

par(mfrow = c(2,2))

plot(model_aic)

```

## Modifying the Model with the VIF

**Variance Inflation Factor :**

$$VIF_{k} = \dfrac{1}{1 - R_{k}^2}$$

$R_{k}^2$ is the R^2-value obtained by regressing the kth predictor on the remaining predictors. VIF gives us an idea of multi-collinearity

* Every explanatory variable would have a VIF score

* A VIF > 4 means that there are signs of multi-collinearity and anything greater than 10 means that an explanatory variable should be dropped

* We use the "vif()" function from the car package. 

```{r}

library(car)

vif(model_basic)

vif(model_aic)

```

* After applying the stepAIC, the VIF values have slightly reduced, but the variables "RAD" and "TAX" have VIF values higher than 4


* let's now remove the "TAX" variable, as it is the lesser significant of the two

* Build another model without the "TAX" variable, and take a look at the VIFs


```{r}

model3 <- lm(formula = MV ~ CRIM + ZN + CHAS + NOX + RM + DIS + RAD + PT + B + LSTAT, data = train_data)

summary(model3)

par(mfrow = c(2,2))

plot(model3)

vif(model3)

```


# Evaluation and Selection of Model

## Picking the Right Model

* The third model built after verifying the vif scores has a similar adjusted R^2 score compared to the previous models with significantly lower no. of explanatory variables and inter-variable interactions.

* The VIF values of the predictors in the third model are lower when compared to the the other two models

* Due to the above two reasons we pick the third model

# Communication

## Prediction

Predict the Housing prices of the unseen boston housing data, using the chosen model.

```{r}

preds_model <- predict(model3, test_data[, !(names(test_data) %in% c("MV"))])

```

## Performance Metrics

Once we choose the model we have to report performance metrics on the test data. We are going to report three error metrics for regression.

### Error Metrics for Regression

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE):

$$MAE = \dfrac{1}{n}\times|\sum_{i = 1}^{n}y_{i} - \hat{y_{i}}|$$


* Mean Squared Error (MSE):

$$MSE = \dfrac{1}{n}\times(\sum_{i = 1}^{n}y_{i} - \hat{y_{i}})^2$$


* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):

$$RMSE = \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{n}\times(\sum_{i = 1}^{n}y_{i} - \hat{y_{i}})^2}$$


* Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):

$$MAPE = \dfrac{100}{n}\times\mid\dfrac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}y_{i} - \hat{y_{i}}}{y_{i}}\mid$$


### Report Performance Metrics

* Report performance metrics obtained by using the chosen model on the test data

```{r}

library(DMwR)

regr.eval(test_data$MV, preds_model)

```
